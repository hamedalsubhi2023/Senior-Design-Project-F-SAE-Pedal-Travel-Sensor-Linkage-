# Senior-Design-Project-F-SAE-Pedal-Travel-Sensor-Linkage-
The goal of this project that was assigned to me duruing my senior design project  was to verify the credibility of a suggested purchase (6061 aluminum rod) to use for making the linkage from the pedal travel sensor to the pedal. The verification was approached using buckling analysis in which the critical load was compared to the estimated applied load. It was found that the critical load is much greater than the applied load, and the suggested purchase can be placed. All in all, it seems the buckling effect on the linkage is not that big deal, but the poor installation of the linkage is what needs to be corrected.
